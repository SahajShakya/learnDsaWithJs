//WHAT IS DATA STRUCTURE?
// * way to organize data so that can be used for effiecient data
// EG: A = [8,2,1,6,0,4,3,7,5]
// Organized A = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] (Sorted)

//WHAT IS ALGORITHM?
//* Steps or a process to arange data
// EG: A = [8,2,1,6,0,4,3,7,5]
// Organized A = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] (Steps to obtain this)
